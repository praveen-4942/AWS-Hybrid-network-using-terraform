# AWS Hybrid Network Infrastructure using Terraform

A production-style AWS Hybrid Networking project built using **Terraform** that demonstrates how to design, provision, and automate an enterprise-grade network infrastructure on AWS.

This project simulates a real-world hybrid cloud environment by integrating multiple AWS Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) with an On-Premises network using a Site-to-Site VPN powered by **StrongSwan**. It also includes Transit Gateway, VPC Peering, NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway, Security Groups, Route Tables, and EC2 instances to showcase modern cloud networking concepts.
